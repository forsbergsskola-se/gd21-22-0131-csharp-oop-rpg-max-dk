# Assignments 003.4 Console Methods

For all of these exercises, it is recommended to:
- Open GitHub Desktop Application
- Select your Assignment Repository (named `gp21-21-1004-csharp-oop-rpg-[yourusername]`)
- Then, from the Menu Bar in GitHub Desktop, select `Repository` > `Open in Terminal` (or `Open in Command Prompt`)
- Switch to the `projects`-directory using `cd projects`
- Create a Project using `dotnet new console -o ProjectName` (replace the Project Name with the name given by each Exercise)
- Add a `.gitignore` to the folder of the newly created Project:
  - First, navigate to the new folder: `cd [ProjectName]`
  - Then, use `dotnet new gitignore`
  - Do NOT commit any files in `/bin/` or `/obj/`, please!
- Open the Project in the IDE of your choice. Remember: Open the `.csproj` file!!
- Then follow the instructions of the exercise

## 1 - Methods: 
[Read the Slides on Methods](../slides/003.4-console-methods.md#1-methods)
### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P1Methods`
- Create a method called `CountUp` that counts from 0 to 5 and prints each number to the console
- Create another method called `CountDown` that counts from 5 to 0 and prints each number to the console
- Call each method twice (first up, then down, then up, then down again)

### Sample
```
Output:Counting from 0 to 5:
Output:0
Output:1
Output:2
Output:3
Output:4
Output:5
Output:Counting from 5 to 0:
Output:5
Output:4
Output:3
Output:2
Output:1
Output:0
Output:Counting from 0 to 5:
Output:0
Output:1
Output:2
Output:3
Output:4
Output:5
Output:Counting from 5 to 0:

Output:0
```

## 2.1 - Parameter:
[Read the Slides on Parameters](../slides/003.4-console-methods.md#2-parameters)
### Instructions
- Continue editing `P1Methods`
- Modify the method `CountUp` to take an argument named `to` of type `int`
  - Modify the method-body so, that counts from 0 to the passed argument (`to`)
- Modify the method `CountDown` to take an argument named `from` of type `int`
  - Modify the method-body so, that counts from the passed argument (`from`) to 0
- Invoke these methods, by passing numbers as arguments, so that you 
  - count from 0 to 1
  - then from 1 to 0
  - then from 0 to 2
  - then from 2 to 0
  - then from 0 to 3
  - then from 3 to 0

### Sample
```
Output:Counting from 0 to 1:
Output:0
Output:1
Output:Counting from 1 to 0:
Output:1
Output:0
Output:Counting from 0 to 2:
Output:0
Output:1
Output:2
Output:Counting from 2 to 0:
Output:2
Output:1
Output:0
Output:Counting from 0 to 3:
Output:0
Output:1
Output:2
Output:3
Output:Counting from 3 to 0:
Output:3
Output:2
Output:1
Output:0
```

## 2.2 - Parameters:
### Instructions
- Continue editing `P1Methods`
- Remove the method `CountUp`
- Modify the method `CountDown` by renaming it to `Count` 
  - add a second argument named `to` of type `int`
  - Modify the method-body so, that counts from the first argument (`from`) to the second argument (`to`)
- Invoke this one method, by passing numbers as arguments, so that you count
  - from 2 to 3
  - from 100 to 101
  - from 10 to 8
  - from 1 to -1
  - from 1337 to 1337
### Sample
```
Output:Counting from 2 to 3:
Output:2
Output:3
Output:Counting from 100 to 101:
Output:100
Output:101
Output:Counting from 10 to 8:
Output:10
Output:9
Output:8
Output:Counting from 1 to -1:
Output:1
Output:0
Output:-1
Output:Counting from 1337 to 1337:
Output:1337
```

## 3 - Return Type:
[Read the Slides on Return Type](../slides/003.4-console-methods.md#3-return-type)
### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P3ReturnType`
- Write a method that returns the Fibonacci-number at certain position in the sequence
- The rules:
  - Fibonacci at position #0 has the value 0
  - Fibonacci at position #1 has the value 1
  - Every high Fibonacci position has the value of the two previous positions combines
    - e.g. Fibonacci #2 has the value of Fibonacci #0 (0) + Fibonacci #1 (1) => 1
    - Fibonacci #3 has the value of Fibonacci #1 (1) + Fibonacci #2 (1) => 2
    - Fibonacci #4 has the value of Fibonacci #2 (1) + Fibonacci #3 (2) => 3
    - Fibonacci #5 has the value of Fibonacci #3 (2) + Fibonacci #4 (3) => 5
- Hint: methods can call themselves :)
- Hint: The Method should have this signature: `static int Fibonacci(int position)`
### Sample
```
Output:Which Fibonacci Number do you want?
Input:6
Output:Fibonacci Number 6 has the value: 8
Output:Which Fibonacci Number do you want?
Input:8
Output:Fibonacci Number 8 has the value: 21
Output:Which Fibonacci Number do you want?
Input:0
Output:Fibonacci Number 8 has the value: 0
```

## Optional Exercises (Good training!):

## 4 - Prime Number (Fairly easy!):
### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P4PrimeNumber`
- Write a method that checks, whether a passed number is a Prime Number.
- The rules:
  - A number is a prime number, if it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
  - A number is divisable by another number, if the division by the other number has no remainder:
    - 4 / 2 = 2 without remainder, 4 is divisible by 2
    - 5 / 2 = 2 with reminder of 1, 5 is not divisible by 2
- Hint: use `%`
- Hint: The method should have this signature: bool IsPrimeNumber(int number);
### Sample
```
Output:Which Number do you think, is a Prime Number?
Input:6
Output:False!
Output:Which Number do you think, is a Prime Number?
Input:7
Output:True!
Output:Which Number do you think, is a Prime Number?
Input:221
Output:False!
```

## 5 - Palindrome (Faily easy!):
### Instructions
- Create a Console Project named `P5Palindrome`
- Write a method that checks, whether a passed text is a Palindrome.
- The rules:
  - A word is a Palindrome, if it reads the same Forwards as well as Backwards.
  - `anna` is a Palindrome, it is backwards `anna`
  - `let` is not a Palindrome, it is backwards `tel`
- Hint: The method should have this signature: bool IsPalindrome(string text);
### Sample
```
Output:Which Text do you think, is a Palindrome?
Input:anna
Output:True!
Output:Which Text do you think, is a Palindrome?
Input:let
Output:False!
Output:Which Text do you think, is a Palindrome?
Input:racecar
Output:True!
```

## 6 - Unravel (Difficult!):
- Create a Console Project named `P6Unravel`
- Create a function called Unravel that takes in a `string` and returns all possible combinations as a `string[]`:
- Examine, how this function works by looking at these examples:
- Examples: 
### Sample
```
Output:Which Text should I unravel?
Input:a[b|c]
Output:ab, ac
Output:Which Text should I unravel?
Input:a[b|c]de[f|g]
Output:abdef, acdef, abdeg, acdeg
Output:Which Text should I unravel?
Input:a[b]c[d]
Output:abcd
Output:Which Text should I unravel?
Input:a[b|c|d|e]f
Output:abf, acf, adf, aef
Output:Which Text should I unravel?
Input:apple [pear|grape]
Output:apple grape, apple pear
```
