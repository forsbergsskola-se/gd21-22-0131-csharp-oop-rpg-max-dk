## 2. Structured Programming
- Programs are divided into functions and data
- Functions
  - Require Data as Input
  - Return Data as Output
- Data
  - Only stores information
- Separation of Data and Functions
```cs
class House {
  bool isOpen;
  Color color;
}

static void OpenHouseDoor(House house) {
  house.isOpen = true;
}

static void CloseHouseDoor(House house) {
  house.isOpen = false;
}

static void SetHouseColor(House house, Color color) {
  house.color = color;
}

static Color GetHouseColor(House house) {
  return house.color;
}

static void Main(string[] args) {
  House house = new Houe();
  OpenHouseDoor(house);
  CloseHouseDoor(house);
  SetHouseColor(house, Color.Red);
  Color color = GetHouseColor(1);
}
```



---

## 3. Object-Oriented

- Programs are divided into objects
- Objects contain functions and data

```cs
class House {
  bool isDoor Open;
  
  public void OpenDoor() {
    this.isDoorOpen = true;
  }

  public void CloseDoor() {
     this.isDoorOpen = true;
  }
  
  public Color color { get; set;}
}

static void Main(string[] args) {
  House house = new House();
  house.OpenDoor();
  house.CloseDoor();
  house.Color = Color.Red;
  Color color = house.Color;
}
```


---

## 4. Classes & Objects

- You can define a class using this syntax:
```cs
public class classs-name {
  class-body
}
```

- Classes are types. Basically Templates for Objects
- The class below contains one `public` `instance` Method
  - It is called `MakeSound`
  - And will become a part of `Animal` instances
- More on that later

```cs
// This defines a new class
public class Animal {
  public void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("...");
  }
}
```

- Objects are instances of those classes
- Create instances using `new` keyword
- And storing the return value in a variable
- Or pass it on to another method

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
  // This creates an instance of the class Animal
  Animal myPet = new Animal();
```

- You can use object instances to call its members.\
- In this case, the `Animal` Class has one `instance` Member:
  - The Method `void MakeSound()`

```cs
  // This calls the instances method. 
  myPet.MakeSound(); // Output:"..."
```

You can create multiple instances of the same class:

```cs
  // This creates another instance of the same class
  // It has it's own method, with the same result: Output: "..."
  Animal yourPet = new Animal();
  yourPet.MakeSound();
```

- To destroy instances, just forget about them
- The feature that takes care of destroying "forgotten" objects, is called `Garbage Collector`, or hort `GC`
- `null` is the keyword for „No Instance“

```cs
  // To destroy an instance, we just need to forget about it
  // The garbage collector will do the rest:
  yourPet = null;
}
```

---

## 5. Class Members

Class Members are parts of the class.\
There can be, as we have seen earlier, methods as class Members.\
Syntax: `public ReturnTyp MethodName() {}`\
Member methods are methods that belong to class instances:

```cs
public class Animal {
  // This is a member method of class Animal
  public void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine("...");
  }
}
```

We can then invoke that Method on instances of the class:

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
  Animal dog = new Animal();
  // we can invoke member methods on the instance:
  dog.MakeSound(); // Output: ...
}
```

Also, there can be fields as class Member.\
Syntax: `public FieldType fieldName;`\
Field are basically variables that belong to a class instance:

```cs
public class Animal {
  // This is a member field of class Animal
  public string name;
}
```

We can use the field on instances of that class:

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
  Animal dog = new Animal();
  // we can assign values to member fields on the instance:
  dog.name = "Bello";
  // and we can read values from the instance:
  Console.WriteLine(dog.name); // Output: Bello
}
```

We can also combine member methods and fields.\
This allows us to acces an instance's field from an instance's method:

```cs
public class Animal {
  public string name;
  public void MakeSound() {
    // here, we can access this animal's name-field:
    Console.WriteLine(name + ":...");
  }
}

static void Main(string[] args) {

  // Create a new Animal instance
  Animal adam = new Animal();
  // Assign the name "Adam" to this Animal instance
  adam.name = "Adam";
  
  // Create another Animal instance
  Animal eva = new Animal();
  // Assign the name "Eve" to this second Animal instance
  eva.name = "Eva";
  
  // This calls the MakeSound-method on the instance
  // On which we set the name to Adam
  adam.MakeSound(); // Output: "Adam:..."
  
  // And this one calls it on the animal with the name Eva
  eva.MakeSound(); // Output: "Eva:..."
}
```

---

## 6. Static Class Members

- Static class members are part of the class-type
- And not part of the instances
- To access them, you use the class‘s type name instead of an instance
  - Static Field: `public static FieldType fieldName;`
  - Static Method: `public static ReturnType MethodName() {}`

```cs
public class Animal {
  public string name;
  // This is a static field
  public static int count;
  
  public void MakeSound() {
    Console.WriteLine(name + ":...");
  }
  
  // This is a static method
  static static void PrintCount() {
    Console.WriteLine("Animal-Count: " + count);
  }
}

static void Main(string[] args) {
  Animal adam = new Animal();
  adam.name = "Adam";
  // Static fields are accessed using the type name
  Animal.Count++;
  
  Animal eva = new Animal();
  eva.name = "Eva";
  Animal.Count++;
  
  // Static methods are accessed using the type name
  
  Animal.PrintCount(); // Output: "Animal-Count: 2"
  
  // Non-static mathods require an instance to be called
  eva.MakeSound(); // Output: "Eva:..."
}
```


- You can even mark a complete class as `static`
  - Only, if all Members are marked `static`, too!
  - This will force you to make all members `static`, too!


```cs
// This is a static class:
public static class Math{
  public static int Add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}
```

```cs
// ERROR: A static class cannot have instance members:
public static class Math{
  public int Add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}
```

It will disable using the `new` keyword to create instances of this class

```cs
public static void Main() {
  // ERROR: This is not possible:
  Math math = new Math();
}
```

Once more, to compare, for a class named `Tree`:

-| static | instance
 :--: | :--: | :--:
keyword | `static` | none (default)
define a field | `public static int count;` | `public int height;`
write to a field | `Tree.count = 5;` | `Tree tree = new Tree(); tree.height = 5;`
read a field | `int i = Tree.count;` | `Tree tree = new Tree(); int i = tree.height;`
define a method | `public static string PrintDefinition(){}` | `public void DoPhotosynthesis(){}`
use a method | `Tree.PrintDefinition();` | `Tree tree = new Tree(); tree.DoPhotosynthesis();`

Now, you probably wonder:\
When to use `static` and when not to?

The question you need to ask for Fields:
Is the Field, that you want to add, something you want every instance to own by itself? e.g.:
- a house's color (one Houe might be red, another one blue)
- a person's name (one person is called Max, another one Anna)
- a unit's health (one unit might have full health, the other one might be almost dead)
Then make it an intance field.

Is the Field something that is shared across all instances of a class? e.g.:
- a counter for how many enemies have been spawned
- a global buff that is applied to all units (like 10% extra damage for everyone)
Then make it a static field.

Do you want to easily access this information globally, because you need it only in one place, e.g.:
- a timer, how long the game still lasts
- the current score of the player
- the information, whether the game is paused
Then you can also make it a static field (at least for now, I will later strongly discourage you of using static fields)

The question you can ask for Methods:
Does the Method require any information from a class's instance? e.g.:
- The `TakeDamage`-Method needs to access a spawned unit's `health`
- The `Attack`-Method needs sto know, who is attacking, and how much damage the attacker can deal
- The `SetPosition`-Method needs to set a certain GameObject's position
Then you want to use an instance Method

Is the Method a very Generic Method, that works independent of an instance of a class? e.g.:
- Any `Math`-function; Mathematical functions don't need to know, who wants to add two numbers, the result will be the same
- A Method that can calculate a path between to locations in an RTS
Then make the method static. Usually, static functions are really used for Calculations and Formulas only

## 7. Constructor

Constructors describe, how a new class instance (object) can be created (constructed).\
They are needed in order to be able to instantiate a class using the `new` keyword.\
They offer us more control over:
- what information is needed to create a class instance
  - e.g. you are not allowed to create a Hero without providing a `name`
- what initial values a class should have
  - e.g. a player's initial health should be `100` and not `0`

```cs
public class Cat 
{

}
```
Constructors are called when a class is constructed through the `new` key-word\
There‘s an invisible Parameterless Default-Constructor for every class doing nothing\
Which means, that above class in reality looks like this:
```cs
public class Cat 
{
  // the invisible, parameter-less constructor looks like this:
  public Cat() 
  { 
  }
}
```
This constructor is called, as soon as you create a new instnce of the class with the `new` keyword\
Note, how we call the Constructor using `()` (a list of zero parameters), just like a parameter-less method:
```cs
Cat meows = new Cat();
```

We can actually change the class to proof, that this is happening:
```cs
public class Cat 
{
  // the invisible, parameter-less constructor looks like this:
  public Cat() 
  { 
     Console.WriteLine("And thus, a new Cat was born!");
  }
}

public class Program {
   static void Main() {
      Cat meows = new Cat();
   }
}
```

Output: `And thus, a new Cat was born!`

The syntax of a Constructor is:
```cs
public ClassName(parameter-list) {
   constructor-body
}
```

You can create your own constructor without parameters, to do some initialization:

```cs
public class Elephant {
  bool hasTrunk;

  // as soon as an elephant is created...
  publlic Elephant() {
    // set `hasTrunk` to true
    this.hasTrunk = true;
  }
}
```

You can also create a constructor with parameters, just like you can create a method with parameters:


```cs
public class Dog {
  string name;
  
  // require a parameter in order to construct a new Dog:
  public Dog(string name) {
    // assign the passed parameters to our own field
    // `this` helps us to access our own field `name` instead of the parameter with the same name:
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

Now, we can create Dogs using the constructor with the correct parameter:
```cs
Dog woofs = new Dog("Woofs");
```

But the invisible default constructor has disappeared now, so we cannot use it anymore:
```cs
// Error: No parameter-less constructor exists!
Dog woofs = new Dog();
```

---

## 8. Finalizer

A Finalizer allows us to take control over what happens as soon as a class instance (object) is destroyed.\
Sometimes, we want to be notified, when something disappeared.\
Or we need to do some clean-up (e.g. remove some temporary files)



The syntax of a Finalizer is:
```cs
~ClassName() {
   finalizer-body
}
```

Let's have a look at the following class with a finalizer:

```cs
public class Animal {
  // Constructor
  public Animal() {
    Console.WriteLine("Animal created.");
  }
  
  // Finalizer
  ~Animal() {
    Console.WriteLine("Animal destroyed.");
  }
}
```

Now, let's create and Finalize a few animals:
```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
  for ( var i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    // This will call the Constructor
    var animal = new Animal(); // Output: Animal created.
    
    // At this point, the loop will start again
    // The old animal variable will then be out of scope
    // And therefore cleaned up by the garbage collector at some point
    // This will call the finalizer (whenever the GC decides to "wake up"
    // To speed this process up, since the garbage collector is slow and lazy:
    // We can call it manually:
    GC.Collect();
  }
}
```

Output:
```
Animal created.
Animal created.
Animal destroyed.
```

The output might confuse you. But it can be explained:
- First, an Animal is created.
- Then, we call the Garbage-Collector, but the animal still exists in the current scope.
- Then, the loop ends, the current scope ends, and the animal variable gets reset.
- Then, we create another Animal.
- Then, we call the Garbage-Collector again. This time, there is an old Animal ready to be cleaned up.
  - That's, why we now see, that one animal was destroyed.

To summarize the Finalizer:
- Opposite of a Constructor
- Defined through `~ClassName()` `{}` Method Signature
- Unreliable (You never know, when it‘s called)
- Dependant on when the Garbage Collector Collects the Object
- Better: IDisposable-Pattern

## 9. Access Modifiers
```cs
public class Animal {
// Private is only accessible by this class
// Everything is private per default
  Color color;
// public is accessible by everyone
  public string name;
  // protected is only accessible by this class and inheritors
  protected int age;
  
  public Animal(int id) {
    this.id = id;
  }

  public void SetAge(int value) {
    this.age = value;
  }
}
static void Main(string[]args) {
var animal = new Animal(5);
  // ERROR: Cannot access private field
  animal.id = 3;
  // Valid: name is a public field
  animal.name = "Adam";
  // ERROR: cannot access protected field
  animal.age = 5;
  // Valid: SetAge is a public method
  animal.SetAge(5);
}
```

Access modifiers are used to limit access to class-Members.\
Sometimes, you don't want other classes to fiddle around with your internal values.\
- e.g. you don't want a class to just set the player's weapon to `null`
- or you don't want other classes to read your application's Security Token

Also, you want to make sure, that other classes only see, what they need to see about your class.
- it makes your classes appear more simple, than they actually are
- which makes it easier to use it
- think about Bluetooth Headphones
  - do you understand, how they work internally?
  - or are you happy, that you only need a Power and a Connect Button to use them?

You can use access modifiers on classes, fields, method, properties.\
Just put the access modified before it.
- `private` (default): available to owning class only
- `protected`: available to owning class and inheriting classes (more on that later)
- `public`: available to all classes
- `internal`: same as `public`, but only within the same Project
  - We will see later, that we can actually have Solutions consisting of multiple Projects!

Let's see, how they each work:

This code sample is invalid, because the default access modifier is `private`\
And we cannot access implicitly `private` Members from outside the class:

```cs
public class Person {
   string name;
}

static void Main() {
   Person max = new Person();
   max.name = "Max";
}
```

This code sample is invalid.\
We cannot access explicitly `private` Members from outside the class:

```cs
public class Person {
   private string name;
}

static void Main() {
   Person max = new Person();
   max.name = "Max";
}
```

This code sample is valid.\
We can access `public` Members from outside the class:

```cs
public class Person {
   public string name;
}

static void Main() {
   Person max = new Person();
   max.name = "Max";
}
```

Let's have a real-world code-sample for Access Modifiers:

```cs
public class Circle {
  // radius is private to avoid other classes of assigning invalid values
  double radius;
  
  // area is private to avoid other classes of assigning other values (which are not really the area)
  double area;
  
  // SetRadius is a public method that you can use to set the radius
  // It validates the radius and updates the area as well
  public void SetRadius(double radius) {
    if (radius <= 0)
      return;
    this.radius = radius;
    this.area = Math.PI * radius * radius;
  }
  
  // GetRadius is a public method to read the radius
  public double GetRadius() {
    return this.radius;
  }
  
  // GetArea is a public method to read the area
  public double GetArea() {
    return this.area;
  }
}
```

Which one to use?
- Make as much use of `private` as possible
  - It offers less confusion to users of your class, if they can only change values that make sense
  - It makes your code more easy to change, because other classes can not rely on `private` fields / methods
  - It prevents other classes to „break“ your classes through invalid changes
  
- Use `protected` if you use inheritance
  - And only, if you expect inheriting classes to need access to a certain field / method
  
- Use `public` for everything you want to make available
  - It should be your conscious intention to make sth. public

- In the beginning:
  - The easiest is, to just make everything `public`, you have to put less thought into it, then.
